# Popcorn Tour
a simple feature tour using popper.js

[Check out Popper.js and it's big brother Floating UI](https://popper.js.org/)

## Getting Started

Popcorn uses popper.js and is written in vanilla JavaScript so it is usable im any application regardless of framework. It does not depend on jQuery, or any other similar library. While they are fantastic and useful, I wanted to make this as simple as possible and see if it was possible in vanilla barebones JS, with the exception of popper.js.

## Installation

1. Include the popcorn.js file in your index.html page, in the header or at the end of the body.
2. kernels.js needs to be in the same folder as the popcorn.js folder. It contains the settings and content for your tour. It is already included in popcorn.js
